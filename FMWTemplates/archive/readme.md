# FMWTemplates/archive

Originally was intending on creating a number of different template files
that define different sources.  After experimenting with this idea, determined
that FME does not provide any way of refreshing a reader allowing you to recapture
column definitions from source files.

In other words the only way to get preconfigured source with column definitions is 
when the reader is added.

For this reason these templates have been moved to the archive directory here.  They
may be useful to see the parameter configurations for different reader types.
