# Examples

This file exists to identify various FMWs that we have in our library
that illustrate using the DataBC Fme framework, and configurations 
for various reader types:

## File Geodatabase Sources

### 

## Multiple SRC Oracle SDE 

### bcts_block_access_roads_sp_bctsprod_sde_bcgw

This one has multiple sources.  The joiner transformers illustrate how
the multiple oracle sources should be configured.

The Third feature type re-uses the connection / configurations 
that were defined for the second feature type.
