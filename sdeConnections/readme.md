# sdeConnections Directory

Currently most of our replications use sde application connects.  For 
application connects you would provide, the application server, and 
port to establish a connection.

Eventually we will be moving to using direct connects for all our
replications.  When this happens this directory will contain the 
arcCatalog Direct Connect connection files used to establish connections
to the various database environments.

Files that will be included in this directory:

- dlv.sde
- tst.sde
- prd.sde
