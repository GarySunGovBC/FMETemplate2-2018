# This file contains parameters that are used by all
# FME files that implement the 2015 FME template.
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# development_credentials_file - This file will be found in the 
#                 the "config" directory.  It is used when a 
#                 fmw is being developed.  It will include 
#                 the database parameters required for the 
#                 script to run.  Once the fmw is deployed
#                 to DataBC's infrastructure this file will 
#                 be ignored as credentials will be retrieved
#                 from pmp 
#
# gov_computers - a list of computers that have access to PMP.  
#                if the script is run on one of these machines
#			     it will retrieve passwords from pmp.
#                if run on another computer not in this list
#                it will try retrieve passwords from a 
#                json file. 
#
# rootscriptdir - The root directory for the FME template.  Relative 
#                 to the default location of this file it should be ../
#                 best practice is to use absolute path for this 
# 			      parameter.
#
# customizescriptdir - The template will search this directory for a 
#                      python file with the same name as the fmw that is 
# 					   being run.  For example if the fmw being run is
#					   myFmwThatCopiesData.fmw, then the template will 
#					   look for a file called myFmwThatCopiesData.py.  
#					   if it finds it, it will use this script.  The script
#					   provides overridden methods for the default 
#					   startup and shutdown routines. 
#
# outputsbasedir - The directory where outputs from FMW's other than the 
#                  destination will get written.  Currently the outputs
#                  include:
#                    - change detection logs
#                    - failed features
#
# changelogsdir - Scripts that use the file change detection feature need a file 
#                 that keeps track of the change dates, allowing the change detection 
#                 to know if a file has changed.  This parameter identifies the 
#                 directory where these files should be stored.  Needs to be a location
#                 that both FME Server, and FME workbench have access to.
